                    <h1>CBB Origins</h1>
                        <p>Founded 1/13/12 on the basis of creating a league for skaters by skaters. I created the league to create an environment that I wished I had when I was in junior roller derby because when I started, junior roller derby was seen more as a halftime show unfortunately. Since our beginning we have strived to promote athleticism, teamwork, sportsmanship, and acceptance in all who have come to us.</p>
                        <p>During our first practice we had ten skaters. We originated as an all-female league but the summer after our first season, there was a boy who was attending our practices but was not part of the league. Before the start of our second season in September 2012, we posed it to our current skaters to try opening our league to being co-ed for one season. The fall back is that we could go back to being all-female if it didn't work out.</p>
                        <p>Now, here we are six years later and still co-ed. We live by our motto: We Are One. When you are part of this team, you are part of the whole, you a player and a teammate first.</p>
