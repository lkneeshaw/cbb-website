                    <p>The Cherry Bomb Brawlers is a co-ed junior roller derby league founded January 13, 2013 by the Jester, a former junior derby skater who wanted to pass on her love of the sport to the next generation of players. We are run by volunteer coaches who strive to promote athleticism, sportsmanship and camaraderie among local kids.</p>
